Smallest Positive Integer Not Representable by Subset Sum

This program finds the smallest positive integer that cannot be formed as a sum of any subset of a given array.

Approach:
- Sort the array.
- Use a greedy method: Keep track of the smallest value that can't be formed.
- If current number is less than or equal to result, update result.

Time Complexity:
O(n log n) due to sorting.

Example:
Input: [1, 1, 3, 4]  
Output: 10
